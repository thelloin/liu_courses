README Container Design, Step 7
-------------------------------
Remodeled memory allocation and deallocation, to make it more efficient, by avoiding initialization of yet unused storage, and logically more correct, by also destroying elements when removed. To accomplish this the allocation of the array of T have been replaced with a new expression like, 'new T[n]', with a call to the global memory allocation function operator new, '::operator new(sizeof(n*T))'. In this way the T default constructor will not be invoked, instead we invoke the copy/move constructor when inserting a T object into the container, using placement new. When removing an element  there is an explicit call to the destructor for that element, and when the container object is to seize to exist, all stored elements are destroyed, and then deallocate the memory using the global memory deallocation function ::operator delete().
